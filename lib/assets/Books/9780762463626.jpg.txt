Fans have fallen in love with Liz Climo's charmingly quirky animal kingdom, which was first featured in The Little World of Liz Climo--and then followed up with Lobster is the Best Medicine. 
Best Bear Ever! follows main characters Bear and Rabbit through the seasons, as they go on adventures, spend time with old friends, and make new ones too! This collection is a mix of new comics and fan favorites, plus a never-before-published long-form comic. Liz's fans will love adding this to their collections, while the "year-long" format will intrigue new readers as well.
