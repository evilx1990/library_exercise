Hot diggity dog! Dog Man, the newest hero from the creator of Captain
Underpants, is back and this time he's not alone. The heroic
hound with a real nose for justice now has a sidekick in the form
of a super-cute kitten, and together they have a mysterious caper
to sniff out! When a new kitty sitter arrives and a glamorous
movie starlet goes missing, it's up to Dog Man and Cat Kid to save
the day! Will these heroes stay hot on the trail, or will they
be thrown off the scent and start barking up the wrong tree?
