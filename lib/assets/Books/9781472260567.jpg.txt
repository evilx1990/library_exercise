When the Syrian civil war forced the people of Aleppo to flee their homes, thousands of the city's pets were abandoned. Heartbroken by the desperate situation, ambulance driver Alaa Aljaleel vowed to stay behind, caring for the children and pets caught in the crossfire. He built a cat sanctuary for Aleppo's helpless creatures, and named it after his kitten Ernesto, who he had rescued from the streets of rubble. 



It became a place of escape and tranquility for children living through the bombardment, and Alaa's extraordinary courage and dedication to caring for those less fortunate than him touched the hearts of people all around the world. Through the kindness of strangers who had heard about his story online, Alaa was able to feed thousands of local families and save hundreds of animals. But when a bomb destroyed their little refuge and Alaa made a perilous escape from Aleppo, he vowed not to give in on his dream, and returned to Aleppo to rebuild his sanctuary, where it thrives to this day. 



THE LAST SANCTUARY IN ALEPPO is an extraordinary modern day war story, providing both a shocking insider account from the siege of Aleppo as well as heartwarming tale about how one person's actions can make a difference against all odds.
