description:
The exquisite colours of enamelling have been the choice of kings for centuries.  This book explains the rich traditions of the magnificent technique of champleve, which combines the skills of engraving and enamelling.  Champleve is a technique of enamelling requiring the creation of a cell into which enamel is then applied.  Celebrating fifty years of working as a master craftsman, Phil Barnes gives a unique insight into all aspects of the process.  He explains the techniques of engraving in preparation for enamelling, and then looks at enamels and how to work with them to create a piece, through to the final polishing and finishing.
