A super-powered collision of extraordinary minds and vengeful intentions--#1 New York Times bestselling author V. E. Schwab returns with the thrilling follow-up to Vicious. 

Magneto and Professor X. Superman and Lex Luthor. Victor Vale and Eli Ever. Sydney and Serena Clarke. Great partnerships, now soured on the vine. 

But Marcella Riggins needs no one. Flush from her brush with death, she's finally gained the control she's always sought--and will use her new-found power to bring the city of Merit to its knees. She'll do whatever it takes, collecting her own sidekicks, and leveraging the two most infamous EOs, Victor Vale and Eli Ever, against each other.

With Marcella's rise, new enmities create opportunity--and the stage of Merit City will once again be set for a final, terrible reckoning.

Praise for Vicious

"Schwab's characters feel vital and real, never reduced to simple archetypes...In a genre that tends toward the flippant or pretentious, this is a rare superhero novel as epic and gripping as any classic comic. Schwab's tale of betrayal, self-hatred, and survival will resonate with superhero fans as well as readers who have never heard of Charles Xavier or Victor von Doom."--Publishers Weekly (starred review)

"V. E. Schwab's Vicious is the superhero novel I've been waiting for: fresh, merciless, and yes, vicious. Wow."--Mira Grant, New York Times bestselling author of Blackout
