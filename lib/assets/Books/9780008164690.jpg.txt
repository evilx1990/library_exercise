description:
David’s magical new masterpiece is the perfect winter’s tale, inviting his readers to journey back to Victorian London in his biggest adventure yet. When Elsie, a young orphan, hears of the arrival of a mysterious Ice Monster – a woolly mammoth discovered at the North Pole – she’s desperate to find out more. A chance encounter brings Elsie face to face with the creature, and sparks the beginning of the adventure of a lifetime – from London to the heart of the Arctic. The Ice Monster is a comedic tale of adventure, possibility and the glorious unlikely friendship of a ten-year-old girl and a 10,000-year-old mammoth. The characters and atmosphere are vividly brought to life by Tony Ross’ stunning line illustrations.
