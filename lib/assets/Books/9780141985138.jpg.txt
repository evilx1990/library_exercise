Could psychedelic drugs change our worldview? Join Michael Pollan on a journey to the frontiers of the human mind.
Diving deep into an extraordinary world - from shamans and magic mushroom hunts to the  pioneering labs mapping our brains - and putting himself forward as a  guinea-pig, Michael Pollan has written a remarkable history of  psychedelics and a compelling portrait of the new generation of  scientists fascinated by the implications of these drugs. How to Change Your Mind is a report from what could very well be the future of consciousness.
'A  sweeping and often thrilling chronicle of the history of psychedelics,  all interwoven with Pollan's adventures as a psychedelic novice. This is  a serious work of history and science, but also one in which the  author, under the influence of toad venom, becomes convinced he's giving  birth to himself' Oliver Burkeman, Guardian
'A mind-altering book ... full of transformations' Richard Godwin, Evening Standard
'An  irresistible blend of history, research and personal experience. In  terms of the psychedelic wave, the book is the big kahuna, the Big Bang  moment for a movement that is gathering force' John McKenna, Irish Times
'Entertaining and engrossing' Paul Laity, Financial Times
'Deeply absorbing, wise and beautifully written' Mick Brown, Literary Review
'An astounding book' Andrew Sullivan, New York Magazine
