description:
The Amazingly Disorganised Help Dictionary is a scrapbook of my brain; how I use my lack of concentration and hyperactivity to be creative, to come up with ideas and to NEVER GIVE UP. It contains random and relatable lists, hot tips, advice, activities, stories from my past, info about how I got started on YouTube, lots of LOLs and so much more!
Hopefully this book will make you laugh, but also help you to see that everyone's brain works differently and that your so-called weaknesses can really be gifts.
See ya later, potata!
DISCLAIMER- This book is NOT actually a dictionary but it's most definitely amazingly disorganised.
