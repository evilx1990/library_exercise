THE NO. 1 BESTSELLER IN AUSTRALIA AND THE UK
BASED ON THE LATEST GROUNDBREAKING SCIENCETHE ULTIMATE GUIDE - HOW TO COMBINE RAPID WEIGHT LOSS AND INTERMITTENT FASTING FOR LONG-TERM GOOD HEALTH
AN EXCITING NEW PROGRAMME BUILT AROUND A MORE MANAGEABLE 800-CALORIE FAST DAY
Six years ago, Dr Michael Mosley started a health revolution with The 5.2 Fast Diet, telling the world about the incredible power of intermittent fasting.
In this book he brings together all the latest science (including a new approach: Time Restricted Eating) to create an easy-to-follow programme.
Recent studies have shown that 800 calories is the magic number when it comes to successful dieting - it's an amount high enough to be manageable but low enough to speed weight loss and trigger a range of desirable metabolic changes.
Depending on your goals, you can choose how intensively you want to do the programme: how many 800-calorie days to include each week, and how to adjust these as you progress.
Along with delicious, low-carb recipes and menu plans by Dr Clare Bailey, The Fast 800 offers a flexible way to help you lose weight, improve mood and reduce blood pressure, inflammation and blood sugars.
Take your future health into your own hands.
