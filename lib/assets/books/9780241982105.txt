***************
'Alderton is Nora Ephron for the millennial generation'  Elizabeth Day
'Steeped in furiously funny accounts of one-night stands, ill-advised late-night taxi journeys up the M1, grubby flat-shares and the beauty of female friendships, as Alderton joyfully booze-cruises her way through her twenties' Metro
'Deeply funny, sometimes shocking, and admirably open-hearted and optimistic'  Daily Telegraph
'The book we will thrust into our friends' hands . . . that will help heal a broken heart. Alderton's wise words can resonate with women of all ages. She feels like a best friend and your older sister all rolled into one and her pages wrap around you like a warm hug'  Evening Standard
'A sensitive, astute and funny account of growing up millennial' Observer
'I loved its truth, self awareness, humour and most of all, its heart-spilling generosity'  Sophie Dahl 
'Alderton proves a razor-sharp observer of the shifting dynamics of long term female friendship' Mail on Sunday
'It's so full of life and laughs - I gobbled up this book. Alderton has built something beautiful and true out of many fragments of daftness'  Amy Liptrot
