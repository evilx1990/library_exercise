description:
This is a wonderful flap book introducing children to the way their own bodies work in a fun and informative way. It is a new, smaller format of the "Look Inside" series, perfect for little fingers. It is full of surprises to keep enquiring minds entertained, including flaps beneath flaps and a cheeky peek inside a toilet cubicle. Young readers' minds will boggle as they learn about how their brains work, what happens when they eat, how their lungs use oxygen and much more.
