Number One bestseller Giraffes Can't Dance from author Giles Andreae has been delighting children for over 15 years. Gerald the tall giraffe would love to join in with the other animals at the Jungle Dance, but everyone knows that giraffes can't dance . . . or can they? 
A funny, touching and triumphant picture book story about a giraffe who finds his own tune and confidence too, with joyful illustrations from Guy Parker Rees and a foiled cover.
... wonderfully funny. - Independent
A fantastically funny and wonderfully colourful  romp of a picture book. All toddlers should grow up reading this or  hearing their parents read it aloud to them. - Daily Telegraph
A joyful read about an outsider who finds  acceptance on his own terms.... there's also a simple moral about  tolerance and daring to be different. - Junior
